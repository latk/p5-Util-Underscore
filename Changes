v1.1.0
     *  Reorganized documentation

        The docs are now organized by topic, instead of by source module. In the
        same vein, the tests were improved.

     *  Improved prototypes for many functions

        Nearly all single argument functions now default to "$_" as their arg.
        This makes their usage in "map" or "grep" more convenient, e.g.

            @classes = map _::class, @objects

     *  Added the "carpf" family of functions for formatted error messages

     *  Added "Data::Dump" functions

     *  Added "_::is_object", "_::is_instance", "_::class_can"

     *  Added various type checking functions

         *  reference validation: is_ref, is_scalar_ref, is_array_ref,
            is_hash_ref, is_code_ref, is_glob_ref, is_regex.
         *  numeric validation: is_int, is_uint.
         *  other functions: is_plain, is_identifier, is_package.

     *  Removed dependency on "Safe::Isa", as we can do the same thing with less
        overhead

     *  Various optimizations were merged from DOLMEN

v1.0.1
     *  fixed bugs that prevented installation on older perls
