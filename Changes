v1.1.1      2014-03-19

    - Removed build files from the manifest.

v1.1.0      2014-03-18

    [New Functionality]

    - Scalars: added is_plain, is_identifier, is_package.

    - Numbers: added is_int, is_uint.

    - Reference Type Validation: added is_ref, is_scalar_ref, is_array_ref,
    is_hash_ref, is_code_ref, is_glob_ref, is_regex.

    - Classes and Objects: added is_object, is_instance, class_can.

    - Exception Handling: added "carpf" family of functions for formatted error
    messages.

    - Miscellaneous Functions: added "Data::Dump" functions.

    [Changed Functionality]

    - Improved prototypes for many functions: Nearly all single argument
    functions now default to "$_" as their arg. This makes their usage in "map",
    "grep", or "for" more convenient, e.g. "@classes = map _::class, @objects".

    [Other Changes]

    - The documentation is now organized by topic, instead of by source module.
    In the same vein, the tests were improved.

    - Removed dependency on "Safe::Isa", as we can do the same thing ourselves
    with less overhead.

    - Various optimizations were merged from DOLMEN
